- 👋 Hi, We are @nftartisan, a group of artists and cultural academics. We create artistic nfts and tokens on the Cardano blockchain and, in addition, we look forward to studying the developments of this sphere and how it affects culture in general.
- 👀 Artisticly, we are interested paintings, drawings, 3D design, and other representations of popular culture.
- 🌱 We are currently learning how to create nfts on Cardano. Something totally new for us.
- 💞️ We're looking to collaborate with other artist and know more about their perpectives.
